To re-calculate plots that have been provided:

run project1_script.py in a command prompt and follow instructions.

i] enter a list of matrix sizes to be compared
	ie: 10 20 30 40 50

ii] specify data that you are interested in viewing
	- the prompt will ask for solution or error
	- specification of either option will produce a set of plots and output data matching the option
		- solution will output a set of plots that include calculated and exact values for both LU and gaussian methods
		- error will produce a text file containing flops, time, and matrix sizes as well as a log-log plot of relative error and matrix size
